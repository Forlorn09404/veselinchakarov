# Personal Portfolio Website

## 📘 Project Overview

This website was created as part of a **school assignment**.  
The objective of the project was to design, develop, and deploy a complete front-end website using modern web technologies and real-world deployment tools.

For this assignment, I chose to build a **personal portfolio website for my dad**, presenting his professional experience, skills, and projects in a clean, structured, and responsive format.

**Student:** Petar V. Chakarov  
**Project Type:** Educational / Class Project

## 👨‍💼 About the Website

The website is designed as a **professional portfolio** and includes the following sections:

- About / Introduction  
- Skills and technologies  
- Work experience and projects  
- Contact information  

The layout and content focus on clarity, usability, and responsiveness, ensuring the website works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Front-End Technologies

- **HTML5**  
  Used for the semantic structure and content of the website.

- **TypeScript**  
  Used instead of plain JavaScript to provide type safety, improve code quality, and make the project easier to maintain.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first CSS framework used for styling, layout, and responsive design.  
  It allows fast development and consistent design without writing large custom CSS files.

---

### Tooling & Build Setup

- **Node.js**  
  Runtime environment used for development tooling.

- **npm**  
  Used to manage dependencies and scripts.

- **PostCSS**  
  Used by Tailwind CSS to process and optimize styles during the build process.

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Hosting

### Hosting Platform

- **Netlify**  
  The website is deployed and hosted using Netlify.

  Features used:
  - Automatic builds and deployments from a Git repository  
  - HTTPS enabled by default  
  - Fast global content delivery  

Each change pushed to the repository automatically triggers a new deployment.

---

### Domain Management

- **GoDaddy**  
  A custom domain was purchased through GoDaddy.

  - DNS records were configured to point the domain to Netlify  
  - The domain is fully integrated with the Netlify deployment  

---

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

1. The project source code is stored in a Git repository  
2. Netlify is connected to the repository  
3. During deployment:
   - Tailwind CSS is built using PostCSS  
   - TypeScript is compiled  
4. Netlify deploys the optimized static site  
5. The custom domain from GoDaddy is linked to the deployed website  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice building a complete front-end website  
- Learn and use modern technologies such as TypeScript and Tailwind CSS  
- Understand real-world deployment workflows  
- Gain experience with hosting platforms and custom domains  
- Create a realistic and practical project instead of a fictional example
